* Non-Equilibrium Transition State Sampling (NETS)

** What?

Start molecular dynamics trajectories (balls) and watch them
fall into basins (nets).

** Why?

For validating committor probability predictions from Markov State
Models (MSMs) of sampled transition processes.

** How?

1) Select nodes in your MSM according to their committor probability.
2) Define criteria for basins.
3) Run multiple molecular dynamics until they satisfy criteria for
   reaching a basin. Use OpenMM for dynamics, and SCOOP for running
   multiple trajectories across heterogeneous resources.
4) Repeat until statistics are good enough.
5) Derive committor correction factors.
